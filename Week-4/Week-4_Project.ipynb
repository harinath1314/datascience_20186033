    "## Automated Breast Cancer Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework, we will consider the problem of early breast cancer detection from X-ray images. Specifically, given a candidate region of interest (ROI) from an X-ray image of a patient's breast, the goal is to predict if the region corresponds to a malignant tumor (label 1) or is normal (label 0). The training and test data sets for this problem is provided in the file `hw6_dataset.csv`. Each row in these files corresponds to a ROI in a patient's X-ray, with columns 1-117 containing features computed using standard image processing algorithms. The last column contains the class label, and is based on a radiologist's opinion or a biopsy. This data was obtained from the KDD Cup 2008 challenge.\n",

Notice that the default logistic regression classifier in `sklearn` classifies a data point by thresholding the predicted class probability $\\hat{P}(Y=1)$ at 0.5. By using a different threshold, we can adjust the trade-off between the true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR) of the classifier. The ROC curve allows us to visualize this trade-off across all possible thresholds.\n",

    "Using the mean imputation increased classification accuracy considerably over the first model. Although the 'classification accuracy' score was very high on the first model, this is due to the very small percentage of patients who have the cancer. Given the limited data (325 remaining complete rows), there were no positive predictions. In other words, the same as our all 0 model from the previous question. This is terrible if we want to detect rare cancers. What we gain in accuracy is a tradeoff with computational complexity. The second model iterates over each column and each value computing means. The final model performs multiple regression iteratively and is by far the most computationally complex of the three models."
